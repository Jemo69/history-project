                    <p class="pl-4 border-l-2 border-gray-200 text-gray-700">The massive industrial expansion led by <strong>Robber Barons</strong> (like Carnegie and Rockefeller) created an enormous, insatiable demand for <strong>unskilled labor</strong> in factories, mines, and railroads. This demand was the primary <strong>pull factor</strong> that spurred the massive wave of immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe, as well as Asia.</p>

                <div>
                    <strong class="block text-lg text-amber-600">Impact on Goals:</strong>
                    <p class="pl-4 border-l-2 border-gray-200 text-gray-700">This influx strengthened the goals of the <strong>Robber Barons</strong> by providing a constant, inexpensive, and easily replaceable workforce. Immigrants, desperate for work and often unfamiliar with English or American customs, were willing to accept long hours, low wages, and dangerous conditions, maximizing the industrialists' profits.</p>

                    <p class="pl-4 border-l-2 border-gray-200 text-gray-700">The swelling population of new <strong>immigrants</strong> greatly complicated the efforts of **labor unions**. The sheer number of workers, combined with the fact that they were often divided by language, culture, and ethnicity, made it difficult to organize them into a unified front.</p>

                <div>
                    <strong class="block text-lg text-emerald-600">Impact on Goals:</strong>
                    <p class="pl-4 border-l-2 border-gray-200 text-gray-700"><strong>Immigration</strong> often weakened the goals of established <strong>labor unions</strong>. Industrialists frequently used recent immigrants as <strong>scabs</strong> (strikebreakers) to replace striking native-born or long-established workers, thereby crushing strikes and suppressing wages for everyone. This led to tension and sometimes outright hostility between unionized workers and the newer immigrants.</p>

                    <p class="pl-4 border-l-2 border-gray-200 text-gray-700">The immense power and wealth concentration of the <strong>Robber Barons</strong>, coupled with their anti-union tactics and exploitation of workers, directly spurred the growth of **labor unions** and political resistance like the **Populist Party**.</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 pl-4 text-gray-700">
                        <li><strong class="font-medium">Labor Unions</strong> (Knights of Labor, AFL) were a direct response to the low wages, dangerous conditions, and lack of worker power.</li>

Conversely, the unions and Populists weakened the industrialists' goals by challenging their absolute power through strikes, political agitation, and demanding government regulation (e.g., the nationalization of railroads).</p>
